**WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

As used herein, the term "Personal Information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, personal website, account names on other services such as GitHub, Twitter and IRC, or credit card or other account number); information about that individual's location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Sites and Services, when directly linked to personally identifiable information; and demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other Personal Information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Sites or about a group or category of products, Services or users, from which individual identities or other Personal Information has been removed. In other words, information about how you use a Service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same Service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Sites. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

**WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

**Active Collection**: We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain Personal Information. For example, we may collect your name, user name, address, email address, telephone number, other contact and demographic information when you register and set up an account, fill out a form, submit a comment or contact us by e-mail or other means. We may also collect billing information, such as your credit card number, when you purchase Services or other items through the Sites. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with creating a profile, leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user or otherwise participating in any interactive forums or community features on the Sites.

**Automatic Collection**: When you use the Sites, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on the Sites. Also, when packages are published in a package registry, the name and email address of the developer for the publish action is saved, along with the date and time of the publish. This information is shared on the Sites. We treat this information as Personal Information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only. When you use our Software, we will (if available) be able to see the relevant software licence key. If the Software is licensed by us, we will be able to link that information with a specific license for the Software you are using. As for when you use our Sites, when you use our Software, we will automatically collect your IP address and operating system information. We also collect information on features used (such as API) and information on how frequently our Software is used.

The Software will generate a unique ID code for each user but we will not be able to link this unique ID code to an individual.

**Cookies**: We may automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Please see our Cookie Policy at [https://www.chef.io/cookie-policy/](https://www.chef.io/cookie-policy/).

**Log Information**: If you create an account and publish a package, your name, email address any information specified in the “maintainer” string, will be publicly disclosed. If users do not want their information tracked in this manner, they can opt to not create an account. However, this means that some features of Habitat Builder or other Services will be unavailable to them. All user information is retained in raw form for such time as deemed appropriate by Chef. It is shared with employees and contractors of Chef, as needed to process information on Chef's behalf. Raw log data is not shared with third parties, but may be shared in aggregate. For example, Chef may publish blog posts or reports on registry or website usage.

We also partner with third party partners to display advertising on our website. Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising [click here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) or if located in the European Union [click here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.

**Information You Provide to Us**: You also may provide information in your profile, recipe pages, blogs, bulletin boards, forums and other community areas of the Sites (the "Community Areas"), to be transmitted to other users of the Sites or third parties, as well as any information you share with individuals through the Sites (collectively, "User Contributions"). Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Sites with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. You understand that when you use the Community Areas, your User Contributions will be available to other users and in some cases may be publicly available. We recommend you be cautious about giving out Personal Information to others or sharing Personal Information in Community Areas, whether designated as public or private. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to share in these Community Areas or for the actions of any third parties with whom you share Personal Information.
