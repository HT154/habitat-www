# Why Habitat?

Habitat exists to solve the problem of how we build, deploy, and manage applications. As Marc Andreessen declared in 2011, [software is eating the world] (http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460). In every sector, in every industry, from small startups to the largest of enterprises, we see software at the center of how we build and run our companies, and how we interact with our customers. This shift forces us all to
become fast, efficient, software-driven organizations&mdash;or lose out to a competitor
who is.
